# Doctor Battery 
## A solution for people who don't disconnect their laptops and keep overcharging them accidentally :( 

**THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM**

A real problem calls for a real solution. This is a script for reckless and absent minded people who often forget to disconnect their charging point and accidentally keep on overcharging the laptops. This has a severe effect on laptops particularly MacBooks by significantly reducing their battery health (which is basically a measure of how healthy a battery is relative to when it was brand new and had 100% charge capacity). This script will give a loud and clear auditory reminding hint and gain the attention of the user to finally DISCONNECT the cable and maintain battery integrity!

Made in goodwill and my convenience ded. 
New feature of increasing the master volume to full volume before the alarm is dropped coming soon [probably idk].

To run the script-

`git clone [repo-name]`

`cd [repo-name]`

`pip install requirements.txt`

`python3 battery_checker.py`
